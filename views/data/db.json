Changed career to a more corporate setting with side hustles (translator/interpreter, got free hotels and travels) and now have my own business/passive income and enjoying my own time. La Salle really does open up opportunities for its graduates. The school speaks for itself and personally, I think one of the most important things that La Salle gave me after graduation was confidence. Might be a CLA thing, but they really teach you to stand up and conquer your inhibitions in Miguel. :)",

I understand that there‚Äôs some overlap in terms of job outlook and subjects. So, more or less, perhaps being a software engineer is still on the table (?) or baka magsshift ako, although I think I will have to spend one more year. The thing is, browsing online, I can‚Äôt seem to pinpoint which college I‚Äôm truly interested in, each with its own pros and cons. My parents are advocating for UP since free nga naman yung tuition.

With this said, the CoE curriculum of upd is quite different from other unis since the three programs in the institute share exactly the same courses until 3rd year 1st sem. So you're gonna be studying broadly and at the same time extensively about topics in the other fields such as circuits, power, communications, semiconductors, signals, etc. Tapos pagdating naman sa specialization majors na in the computer engineering, medyo different yung approach ng EEEI since we are not learning any specific tools in solving problems. You can view how you want it but it's technology-agnostic kumbaga unlike in other courses offered in other universities, you are somehow at least trained or expected to have a specific skillset or say tech stack after college. Here, it's a big culture of rigorous and just enough independent studying so that you can be prepared for any kind of career path you want after.",

Math and physics (all the math stuff) were really my weaknesses during 10th grade that's why i'm pursuing humss.

Although, kung maganda grades mo pero di ka naman nakapasa ng DCAT, it'll be a huge problem. DCAT is a big factor for ur acceptance. Phillippines CETs are typically STEM-centered tbh but don't fret, DCAT is fairly easy. I believe it's the easiest CET out of the top 4 unis (UP, ADMU, UST). NOTE: USTET was really hard, very STEM-based siya (hindi ako STEM student) so I guessed my way through the whole test but I thankfully passed. ACET was okay but we only had a limited amount of time talaga, same with USTET. But this isn't the case with DCAT. DCAT gives u just the right amount of time to answer all of the questions <3 ). If you are weak in math and science, then you should definitely study hard and focus on that when you're preparing for the DCAT. I suggest you take a lottt of practice tests. When I took DCAT a few months ago, mainly trigo, geometry, and logarithms mga nasa test for Math. But to give u some comfort, tbh I also guessed my way through the Math and Science portion ng DCAT pero nakapasok naman ako for an engineering program so may chance talaga",

Aside from that the system of wanting to change sections sure is very friendly if one wants to change sections they would need to reach the department they are in and if the student chooses to go to the department in person the intercom that is needed to communicate wouldn't work so the student is taught a lesson do not switch sections. The university has a large array of magnificent teachers but some of them couldn't even teach but that's to be expected no university is perfect just know that outside the campus it becomes a major shit show bunch street kids and beggars the sweet aroma of disposed waste by the side of the road will increase your life span.",
